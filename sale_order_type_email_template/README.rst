As a sales administrator, I access order types from the `Sales > Configuration > Sale Order Types` menu. 
From the form view, I see that a new `Email Template` field is available.

For each type of order, I define the email template to use.

As a sales user, I create a quotation. 
Then, I select the type of quotation, then I send it by email by clicking on the `Send by Email` button.
